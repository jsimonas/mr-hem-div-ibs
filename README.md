Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis between hemorrhoidal disease (HEM) and diverticular disease (DIV) or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

The repository contains the following analysis reports, including source code, results, and software versions:

  1. Bidirectional two-sample MR analyses ([reports/mr_analysis.md](https://github.com/jsimonas/mr-hem-div-ibs/blob/main/reports/mr_analysis.md));
  2. Causal Analysis Using Summary Effect estimates (CAUSE) MR analysis ([reports/mr_cause_analysis.md](https://github.com/jsimonas/mr-hem-div-ibs/blob/main/reports/mr_cause_analysis.md));
  3. Methodological repetition of [Zhu *et al.*](https://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2023/01/23/gutjnl-2022-329307-0) study ([reports/mr_replication.md](https://github.com/jsimonas/mr-hem-div-ibs/blob/main/reports/mr_replication.md));
  4. Linkage disequilibrium analysis of IVs using different clumping thresholds ([reports/mr_iv_ld_analysis.md](https://github.com/jsimonas/mr-hem-div-ibs/blob/main/reports/mr_iv_ld_analysis.md));
  5. Methodological refinement of [Zhu *et al.*](https://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2023/01/23/gutjnl-2022-329307-0) study ([reports/mr_refinement.md](https://github.com/jsimonas/mr-hem-div-ibs/blob/main/reports/mr_refinement.md));.
